Sometimes I forget to wash my *clothing item* and it ends up smelling like *fried food*. Sometimes I forget to clean my *body part*, too and then my *clothing item*, really smells like a *room of the house* after a long day of *verb ending in "ing"* and farting. Oh mad, I should really clean up better! Sometimes I find a *type of bug* in my shoe after playing *noun* for too long. And sometimes I find *animal* poop under my shoe, and I get *flavor* smells all over my mom's *clothing item*.
